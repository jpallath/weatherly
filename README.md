## Weatherly React Project

This was another one off project in building a React App that uses dummy Weather data to show a five day forecast.  This project demonstrates react router's use along with passing state/props from one route to another.  Along with that, I was able to show two concurrent paths where one component relied on the actions made in another component.

For example:
A user will click the monday forcast and the secondary component would show more information about that specific day via the url params.
